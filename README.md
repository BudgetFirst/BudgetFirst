# Budget First
Budget First is an open source budget application based on the envelope budgeting or zero-sum budget approach, in which income is partitioned in various categories and spending only occurs from these categories.

It is currently in development. To check out or help contribute to the planning discussion, please visit the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/budget-first)!
